# Using the Program

The program‚Äôs main window has two primary panels:

- **Local Dir (Local Directory):** Lists the files and folders on your local machine.
- **Remote Dir (Remote Directory):** Lists the files and folders on the connected FTP server.

### Uploading and Downloading Files

- To upload a file to the FTP server, drag it from the local panel (left) to the remote panel (right).
- To download a file from the FTP server, drag it from the remote panel (right) to the local panel (left).
- Drag-and-drop within the same panel does not work; drag-and-drop is only for transferring files between the local and remote panels.
- When files are dragged to upload or download, the operation is performed in the directory currently displayed in that panel.

### Navigating Directories

- Items with the **üìÅ** icon at the beginning of their name are folders. You can **double-click** these folders in both the local and remote directories to open them. To go back (when possible), click the **..** item at the top.

### Creating a New Folder

- Click the **(üìÅ Create Folder)** button on the relevant panel to create a new folder in that directory.

### Refreshing Directories

- Directories are automatically refreshed after each operation. However, if needed, you can manually refresh a directory by clicking the **(üîÑ Refresh)** button on the respective panel.

### Deleting and Renaming

- In both panels, **right-click** on a file to see options for **Rename** and **Delete**.
- When you click **Rename**, you will be prompted for a new name, and the file will be renamed.
- When you click **Delete**, the file will be deleted.

### Logging Out

- Click the **(‚ùå Logout)** button at the top-left corner of the program window to close the FTP connection and return to the login screen.
